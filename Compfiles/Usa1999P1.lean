USA Mathematical Olympiad 1999, Problem 1

Some checkers placed on an n × n checkerboard satisfy the following conditions:
 a. every square that does not contain a checker shares a side with one that does;
 b. given any pair of squares that contain checkers, there is a sequence of squares
    containing checkers, starting and ending with the given squares, such that
    every two consecutive squares of the sequence share a side.

Prove that at least (n²-2)/3 checkers have been placed on the board.
