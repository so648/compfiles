# International Mathematical Olympiad 2001, Problem 3

Twenty-one girls and twenty-one boys took part in a mathematical competition.
It turned out that each contestant solved at most six problems, and for each
pair of a girl and a boy, there was at most one problem solved by both the
girl and the boy. Show that there was a problem solved by at least three
girls and at least three boys.

# Solution
Note that not all of the problems a girl $g$ solves can be "hard" for boys, in the sense that
at most two boys solved it. If that was true, by condition 1 at most $6 × 2 = 12$ boys solved
some problem $g$ solved, but by condition 2 that property holds for all 21 boys, which is a
contradiction.
Hence there are at most 5 problems $g$ solved that are hard for boys, and the number of girl-boy
pairs who solved some problem in common that was hard for boys is at most $5 × 2 × 21 = 210$.
By the same reasoning this bound holds when "girls" and "boys" are swapped throughout, but there
are $21^2$ girl-boy pairs in all and $21^2 > 210 + 210$, so some girl-boy pairs solved only problems
in common that were not hard for girls or boys. By condition 2 the result follows.
