# International Mathematical Olympiad 1986, Problem 1

Let d be any positive integer not equal to 2, 5 or 13.
Show that one can find distinct a, b in the set {2, 5, 13, d} such that ab - 1
is not a perfect square.

We prove a slightly stronger statement, namely:
Let d be any integer, then 2 * d - 1, 5 * d - 1 and 13 * d - 1 can't all be perfect squares.
We follow "Solution 2" on https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/1986_IMO_Problems/Problem_1
by showing a contradiction: we show d is odd and d is even.
First we assume that there are p, q and r such that:
2 * d - 1 = p^2
5 * d - 1 = q^2 and
13 * d - 1 = r^2

The fact that d is odd follows from the fact that p is odd.
The fact that d is even follows from examining the difference 13 * d - 5 * d.
